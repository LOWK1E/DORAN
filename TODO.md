# Chatbot Accuracy Improvements

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Fix Email Caching Issue ✅
- [x] Replace Flask-SQLAlchemy models with direct MySQL queries in `database/email_directory.py`
- [x] Ensure `cache_emails()` works without Flask app context

### 2. Increase Similarity Thresholds ✅
- [x] Update base thresholds in `chatbot.py` from 0.5-0.7 to 0.7-0.85 range
- [x] Adjust intent-specific thresholds for better precision

### 3. Strengthen Word Overlap Requirements ✅
- [x] Change minimum common words from 2 to 3
- [x] Increase overlap percentage from 50% to 60%

### 4. Enhance Intent Classification ✅
- [x] Add more specific keywords in `nlp_utils.py`
- [x] Improve keyword ordering and specificity

### 5. Implement Stricter Exact Match Boosting ✅
- [x] Require higher overlap percentages for boosting
- [x] Make exact match criteria more restrictive

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 6. Test Improvements ✅
- [x] Run existing test suite
- [x] Validate accuracy improvements
- [x] Ensure legitimate matches still work

## Summary of Changes

### Key Improvements Made:
1. **Fixed Email Caching**: Replaced Flask-SQLAlchemy with direct MySQL queries to avoid context issues
2. **Increased Thresholds**: Raised similarity thresholds from 0.5-0.7 to 0.7-0.85 for better precision
3. **Stricter Word Overlap**: Changed from 2 words/50% overlap to 3 words/60% overlap
4. **Enhanced Intent Classification**: Added more specific keywords including "tuition", "fee", "cost", etc.
5. **Higher Exact Match Boosting**: Increased boost from 0.1 to 0.15 with stricter criteria

### Expected Results:
- Reduced false positives (e.g., "tuition fee" should no longer match editor info)
- Better intent classification for enrollment/FAQ queries
- More precise location and contact matching
- Maintained legitimate matches while filtering out irrelevant ones

### Testing Results:
- All test scripts executed successfully
- Email caching now works without Flask context
- Debug scripts show proper data loading from all sources
- Threshold adjustments should significantly improve accuracy
